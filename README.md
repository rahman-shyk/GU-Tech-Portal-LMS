# GU Tech LMS

A learning management system for students, teachers, and administrators. This project was built with [Lovable](https://lovable.dev) and uses Supabase for authentication, PostgreSQL, and file storage.

## Requirements

- Node.js and npm
- A Supabase project

## Local development

```sh
git clone <this-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root with credentials from **Supabase → Project Settings → API Keys**:

```env
SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-ref
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-publishable-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-secret-key

VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-ref
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-publishable-key
```

Use the publishable key for `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and its `VITE_` counterpart. Use the project's secret API key (or legacy `service_role` key) for `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. All values must belong to the same Supabase project. The project ID variables are included for tooling compatibility; the application connects using the URL and keys.

`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` bypasses row-level security. Keep it server-only: never prefix it with `VITE_`, expose it in browser code, commit it, or share it. Restart the dev server after changing `.env`. Set the same server-side variables in your hosting provider for deployment.

## Initialize the Supabase database

For a new Supabase project, open **Supabase → SQL Editor** and run the project's SQL migrations in order:

1. `drizzle/migrations/0000_migration.sql`
2. `drizzle/migrations/0001_migration.sql`

Run each migration once, in full. The second migration depends on the tables and functions created by the first. Do not use `schema.sql` as a migration; it is a schema reference, not an executable migration. The migrations create the app's tables, row-level security policies, and gradebook view.

### Optional demo data

After both migrations have run, you can run `supabase/demo_seed.sql` in the SQL Editor to add sample courses, enrollments, announcements, assignments, quiz questions and attempts, class chat messages, and complaints. The seed reuses existing profiles (preferring accounts already assigned the relevant roles) and does not create Auth users or change profiles or roles. At least one account/profile must already exist.

The seed does not add resource rows because downloadable materials need real files in the `lms` Storage bucket. Upload sample files from a course's Materials tab instead. It also leaves the audit log untouched so demo activity is not recorded as real administrative activity.

## Create the first administrator

Public signup is disabled. To bootstrap the first admin, first create your own account in **Supabase → Authentication → Users**. Then run this in the SQL Editor, replacing the email and name with your account details:

```sql
do $$
declare
  target_email text := 'you@example.com';
  target_name text := 'Your Name';
  target_user_id uuid;
begin
  select id into target_user_id
  from auth.users
  where lower(email) = lower(target_email);

  if target_user_id is null then
    raise exception 'No auth user found for that email';
  end if;

  insert into public.profiles (id, full_name, email)
  select target_user_id, target_name, email
  from auth.users
  where id = target_user_id
  on conflict (id) do nothing;

  insert into public.user_roles (user_id, role)
  values (target_user_id, 'admin'::public.app_role)
  on conflict (user_id, role) do nothing;
end $$;
```

Sign out and back in to refresh the app's role. Roles belong in `public.user_roles` and are checked with `has_role()`; do not store authorization roles in `profiles`. After the first admin is set up, create and manage users from the app's **Users** page.

## Troubleshooting

- **“Unregistered API key”**: verify that `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` both belong to the same project and that the server key is a secret/service-role key, not the publishable key.
- **Foreign key error referencing `profiles`**: make sure the signed-in Auth user has a matching row in `public.profiles`. The first-admin SQL above creates the profile if it is missing.
- **“Could not find table/view in the schema cache”**: check that both migrations have run successfully in order. Then refresh the app; if the view was just created and the error persists, reload the Supabase schema cache or wait briefly and retry.
- **Ambiguous relationship between `submissions` and `profiles`**: the student and grader IDs both reference profiles. Queries embedding a submission's student profile must specify `profiles!submissions_student_id_fkey(...)`.
